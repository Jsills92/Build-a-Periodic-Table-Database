This is my freecodecamp project where I finished creating and updating a periodic_table database.
Secondly, I used Git to create a repository.
Lastly, I created some bash scripts to access the database.

Throughout this project, I enhanced my POSTGRES SQL abilities, GIT knowledge, and Scripting using BASH.
